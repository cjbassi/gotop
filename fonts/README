`Lat15-VGA16-braille.psf` is a Linux console font based on `Lat15-VGA16.psf`
with additional braille and graphic block characters suitable to run gotop
on the Linux console without a graphic environment. To use the braille font,
just run `setfont Lat15-VGA16-braille.psf`.

To rebase the braille and graphic block characters on a different 16x8
psf font, use the psf2txt and txt2psf from psftools[1]. In this case, make
sure the `Length:` entry in the file header is set to 512.

The original `Lat15-VGA16.psf` font file was obtained from the Ubuntu 18.04
console-setup-linux package[2]. Console fonts are public domain by nature[3].
