## [3.4.5] - ??

### Added

- Device data export via HTTP. If run with the `--export :2112` flag (`:2112`
  is a port), metrics are exposed as Prometheus metrics on that port.
- A battery gauge as a `power` widget; battery as a bar rather than
  a histogram.
- Temp widget displays degree symbol (merged from BartWillems, thanks
  also fleaz)
- Support for (device) plugins, and abstracting devices from widgets. This
  allows adding functionality without adding bulk.

### Fixed

- Keys not controlling process widget, #59
- The one-column bug, #62

## [3.3.2] - 2020-02-26

Bugfix release.

### Fixed

- #15, crash caused by battery widget when some accessories have batteries
- #57, colors with dashes in the name not found.
- Also, cjbassi/gotop#127 and cjbassi/gotop#130 were released back in v3.1.0.

## [3.3.1] - 2020-02-18

- Fixed: Fixes a layout bug where, if columns filled up early, widgets would be
  consumed but not displayed.
- Fixed: Rolled back dependency update on github.com/shirou/gopsutil; the new version
  has a bug that causes cores to not be seen.

## [3.3.0] - 2020-02-17

- Added: Logs are now rotated. Settings are currently hard-coded at 4 files of 5MB
  each, so logs shouldn't take up more than 20MB.  I'm going to see how many
  complain about wanting to configure these settings before I add code to do
  that.
- Added: Config file support. \$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gotop/gotop.conf can now
  contain any field in Config.  Syntax is simply KEY=VALUE.  Values in config
  file are overridden by command-line arguments (although, there's a weakness
  in that there's no way to disable boolean fields enabled in the config).
- Changed: Colorscheme registration is changed to be less hard-coded.
  Colorschemes can now be created and added to the repo, without having to also
  add hard-coded references elsewhere.
- Changed: Minor code refactoring to support Config file changes has resulted
  in better isolation.

## [3.2.0] - 2020-02-14

Bug fixes & pull requests

- Fixed: Rowspan in a column loses widgets in later columns
- Fixed: Merged pull request for README clean-ups (theverything:add-missing-option-to-readme)
- Added: Merge Nord color scheme (jrswab:nordColorScheme)
- Added: Merge support for multiple (and filtering) network interfaces (mattLLVW:feature/network_interface_list)
- Added: Merge filtering subprocesses by substring (rephorm:filter)

## [3.1.0] - 2020-02-13

Re-homed the project after the original fork (trunk?) was marked as
unmaintained by cjbassi.

-  Changed: Merges @HowJMay spelling fixes
-  Added: Merges @markuspeloquin solarized themes
-  Added: Merges @jrswab additional kill terms
